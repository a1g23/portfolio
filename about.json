    "bio": "I am currently in enterprise sales, working with the largest financial services companies in the world on implementing cutting edge AI and data strategies within their marketing funnels. Seemless integrations and workflows are of the upmost importance for these firms and my technical skillset helps me to consult in a way that delivers more value for my clients. Prior to Fidelity Labs, my career was on the GTM enablement and analytics side of things. Working with makreting and sales teams to bring the best technology and processes in place to hit revenue goals. That experience helps bring a 360 degree view to all business decisions. So, with experience in analytics and enablement I found it valuable to pair that with client facing experience, so I decided to be a BDR and work my way to enterprise sales in less than 2 years. The last piece was a strong technical skill via General Assembly's Software Engineering boot camp to hit on that consultative approach."
